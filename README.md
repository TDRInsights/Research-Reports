Exosomes, or Extracellular Vesicles, are tiny vesicles released into body fluids when multivesicular bodies and the plasma membrane fuse together. They contain genetic information and cell-specific proteins that help cells communicate with each other throughout the body.
As exosomes have exceptional capabilities in immune responses and delivering biomolecules, they can be released by almost all eukaryotic cells, and their contents can vary quite significantly depending on the cell type and current state. This makes them an incredibly versatile tool for modifying biological responses. Exosome technologies have been causing quite a stir in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical fields lately. With their potential to serve as diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it's no wonder there's been a surge in R&D activity and demand for drug therapies. These technologies have shown great promise in treating diseases such as neurodegeneration, cardiovascular dysfunction, and cancer.

Exosomes are being widely researched for their ability to transport proteins and nucleic acids from their source, making them valuable in diagnostics. Thus, they have been employed in disease diagnosis and monitoring. For instance, exosomal CD63 has proven effective in detecting melanoma, while exosomal tau has been used to identify early signs of Alzheimer's disease. The potential of exosomes in medicine is indeed promising, and further research in this area is warranted.
